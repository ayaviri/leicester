# Leicester Transit Agency (LTA)

A bus transit system + route planning app for Leicester, MA. Built using a custom GTFS feed for the proposed Leicester bus transit system, [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org) (OTP) for the backend and [OTP-RR](https://github.com/opentripplanner/otp-react-redux) as the frontend

## Running locally

See the documentation to prop up both the [frontend](https://github.com/ayaviri/leicester/blob/main/services/ui/README.md) and [backend](https://github.com/ayaviri/leicester/blob/main/services/otp/README.md) services
